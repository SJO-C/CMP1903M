# CMP1903 Report
My code was reviewed by Kieran Rawlings (25751176); Edward Olley (25769056) and Anthony Goddard (25710847). 
The main Comments by Kieran were regarding lack of comments and error handling, whilst Ed noted that File Paths were not very intiutive to deal with. Anthony and Kieran both noted that the Regex was useful and potentially added to efficiency. However,when Ed stress-tested the code with a 1.3GB text file, the program produced an Out of Memory Error, however I have chosen not to handle this owing to the edge-case that this would be.
